- i think i can work better if i am discussing as i work. I will be working on pytorch + computer vision code and will discuss  ideas or difficulties. most of the time just explaining helps. from time to time i will ask you to look osmething up pon chatgpt or google.

its easier to get things done while discussing. The work will mostly be in pytorch +computer vision, but may involve other python workflows such as fastapi, pygame, huggingface LLM etc. Typical parts of a session will be me explaining what i am doing, and asking to look up something on chatgpt, or try out some code from it. This helps explore more things quickly.
