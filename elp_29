INTRO:
   it asks if the model's processing behaviour has properties that are common sense to humans.
   or heat maps, highlighting regions that strongly influence the output
   , but their independence
   are combined -> are used
   importance of using the imaeg at -> benefits of using
   CAMERAS' tecnique -> the CAMERAS pipeline
   image or its zoom -> zoomed version of the image
   single step of iterative (like EP)
   confidently high scoring crops. Further, we also utilize crops with high uncertainty, which mightbe badly represented by the data used to fit the regressor.
   across multiple CNN -> across different CNN architectures
CONC:
    as we discuss
    sess section i at end
    such an technique -> iterative method
    fits a lightweight regressor ... of the image
    it to sample promising crops
    base EP method
    limit the amount of overhead it adds.
    of our approach, Multiscale Perturbatin (MSP)
    demonstratating improved
    We perform ablation experiments against baselines to investigate the reason's for this improved performance
    as well as its failure cases
EXP:
    scales 1-4
    with multiple: with 2 different 
    with sESS and CAMERAS -> SESS or CAMERAS
    across most classes ->  across most categories
    table 1: best in bold
    without consideration of their value -> without consideration of their potential value
   (i),(ii) for baselines
   refine g with EP --> refine g
   caputre importanes well -> capture importances completely
   importance sampling? -> (with uncertainty)
EP:
    forms the basis of our apporach?
    under this regime -> uner this setup
    however the CNN loss \ref.. seeks to maximize
    solve for he pre mask instead of the mask
APPR:
    havent read algo
    havent looked at image caption
    collect B random crops {\bar{I}}
    we textit{sample} the scores ... from the posterior predictive
    has low uncertainty and high predicted mean ? vs high predicted mean
RELATED:
    In that work, notion of zoom...
