INTRO:
   it asks if the model's processing behaviour has properties that are common sense to humans.
   or heat maps, highlighting regions that strongly influence the output
   , but their independence
   are combined -> are used
   importance of using the imaeg at -> benefits of using
   CAMERAS' tecnique -> the CAMERAS pipeline
   image or its zoom -> zoomed version of the image
   single step of iterative (like EP)
   confidently high scoring crops. Further, we also utilize crops with high uncertainty, which mightbe badly represented by the data used to fit the regressor.
   across multiple CNN -> across different CNN architectures
CONC:
    as we discuss
    sess section i at end
    such an technique -> iterative method
    fits a lightweight regressor ... of the image
    it to sample promising crops
    base EP method
    limit the amount of overhead it adds.
    of our approach, Multiscale Perturbatin (MSP)
    demonstratating improved
    We perform ablation experiments against baselines to investigate the reason's for this improved performance
    as well as its failure cases
