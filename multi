- results on imagenet compare agains scorecam, gradcam,igospp, extremal perturbation (100 images for each of imagenet-5000?)

- runcifar with DBG_WRAPPER=1

generate... run_imagenet_for_multi.json
- run multi on smaller datasets
- MULTI:sharpness annealing
running all methods on the smaller one, 
run all mnist resnet8
run all cifar-100 resnet8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are the transforms for mnist correct? same for training as for torchray?
- run everything vgg_bn? for imagenet maybe yes?
- Why can't IGOS be added for smaller datasets? because of hyperparams.
- Why can't ELP be added for smaller datasets? because of hyperparams

6>DELETION
- ijcai ROC curve https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0442.pdf ( see thepercentages in the curves)
- fullgrad deletion curves
- Akash what were the percentages for gpnn deletion evaluation, or do i run everything again?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- svhn in torchray. run pointing. find pretrained
- from igos paper: ebp, mp,ep, gradcam,rise, integrated grads
- ABLATIONS: number of thresholds, elp based masking, and my masking?
=======================================================================
RECHECK
- how to aggregate channels in integrated gradients -- i am just going to average and then take the absolute valu (absolute value?)
- MULTI: seems to use cifar10
- MULTI: IGOS methods: (RISE, GCAM,IG,Mask(Meaningful Per),IGOS,IGOS++). SESS: GroupCAM, GuidedBackprop, GradCAM -> :(RISE,GroupCAM,GuidedBackprop,GradCAM,),(Igospp,IG)
- MULTI: IGOS methods: (RISE, GCAM,IG,Mask(Meaningful Per),IGOS,IGOS++). SESS: GroupCAM, GuidedBackprop, GradCAM -> :(RISE,GroupCAM,GuidedBackprop,GradCAM,),(Igospp,IG)
- instead of assert, change those statements to pause
- MULTI: add inegreted grad to torchray
- resnet8 is working with 32 input
- all resnet8
- add training and saving of dataset to cifar-fast-simple
- add preprocess of mnist to cifar-fast-simple
- add saving according to dataset name
- MULTI- how to train on mnist, check from mnist code.
- MULTI: find pretrained mnist cifar. lets go with cifar 100
- MULTI: smaller_datasets imported within datasets
- MULTI: seems to use cifar10
DONE
- finish deletion
- deletion and insertion game in optimization
- mnist for detection or small datasets for detection. 
- cifar in torchray. dont run pointing
    - make deletionbenchmark
- MULTI: add inegreted grad to torchray
- MULTI Akash add methods for deletion game to torchray ( from sess paper)
- how many steps in ig?: 50 , taking default value from captum
- MULTI: smaller_datasets imported within datasets
- MULTI: find pretrained mnist cifar. lets go with cifar 100
- add 3 channelmnist and resize to 32 in mnistdataset
LATER:
- metricsdatahandler
- average across percentages or not in deletion? YES to keep it consistent across number of thresholds, it should be average? should be in icdmpaper
- ( pmasked -p) or (p - pmasked): we did see negative scores -> we take difference (was that for deletion?). - should also store areas in deletion
- average deletion
- we will have to rerun deletion on all methods on 2 datasets and 2 arch
DOING
- run on imagenet: grad_cam, rise, groupcam, scorecam, guided_backprop, gradient, excitation_backprop * (vgg,resnet) --save_detailed_results true
NOT DOING
- run all imagenet evaluations on compiled models! --> not possible because of grad_cam issues
