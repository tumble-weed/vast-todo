1- MULTI: seems to use cifar10
- MULTI: IGOS methods: (RISE, GCAM,IG,Mask(Meaningful Per),IGOS,IGOS++). SESS: GroupCAM, GuidedBackprop, GradCAM -> :(RISE,GroupCAM,GuidedBackprop,GradCAM,),(Igospp,IG)
- MULTI Akash add methods for deletion game to torchray ( from sess paper)
- MULTI: add inegreted grad to torchray

- instead of assert, change those statements to pause
- MULTI: find pretrained mnist cifar. lets go with cifar 100
- MULTI: add inegreted grad to torchray

    6>DELETION
    - ijcai ROC curve https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0442.pdf
    - fullgrad deletion curves
    - make deletionbenchmark
    - metricsdatahandler
    - we will havetorerun deletion on all methods on2 datasets and 2 arch
    - average across percentages or not in deletion? YES to keep it consistent across number of thresholds, it should be average? should be in icdmpaper
    - ( pmasked -p) or (p - pmasked): we did see negative scores -> we take difference (was that for deletion?). - should also store areas in deletion
    - average deletion
    - what were the percentages for gpnn deletion evaluation, or do i run everything again?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        - MULTI:sharpness annealing
        - svhn in torchray. run pointing. find pretrained
        - finish deletion
        - mnist for detection or small datasets for detection. 
        - cifar in torchray. dont run pointing
        - deletion and insertion game in optimization
        - from igospape: ebp, mp,ep, gradcam,rise, integrated grads
        - ABLATIONS: number of thresholds, elp based masking, and my masking?
        - run all evaluations on compiled models!
        - run everything vgg_bn?

RECHECK
- resnet8 is working with 32 input
- all resnet8
- add training and saving of dataset to cifar-fast-simple
- add preprocess of mnist to cifar-fast-simple
- add saving according to dataset name
- MULTI- how to train on mnist, check from mnist code.
- MULTI: find pretrained mnist cifar. lets go with cifar 100
- MULTI: smaller_datasets imported within datasets
- MULTI: seems to use cifar10

DONE

- add 3 channelmnist and resize to 32 in mnistdataset
