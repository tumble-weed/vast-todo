Call For Special Session Proposals

IEEE WCCI 2024 solicits proposals for special sessions within the technical scope of the three conferences. Special sessions, to be organized by internationally recognized experts, aim to bring together researchers in special focused topics. Cross-fertilization of the three technical disciplines and newly emerging research areas are strongly encouraged. Inquiries regarding special sessions and proposals should be addressed to Special Sessions Chairs.
