- not enough water
- eating incorrectly
    - eating the wrong things
    - not enough protein:
        but am eating so much paneer. cant be that then...
- not stretching enough:
    - waking up fatigued. could be due to that
- not enough sleep
    - waking up fatigued. could be bad sleep or mybe the "soaking in" of fatiuge. could alos be dehydration catching up?
- some "toxin": something that you're eating or inhaling

it feels like: during fever as if nothing can be done to come out of this.feverishness of the whole body. recurrence of fatigue every few hours. need to keep sleeping. fear time is going.
