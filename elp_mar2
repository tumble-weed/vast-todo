DONE
    - reduce names of conferences
    - table1, table 2 and table 3 caption is too close to the table
    - what is the guideline regarding table caption for icpr
        above th table
    - make sanity checks flat: elp_with_scales_sanity_juco_imagenet_vgg16.drawio.png
    - figure 5 might be too big as well
    figure 4 and 1 convert into horizontal format

    table1 exceeding the margins
    figure 4 has caption in red
        paper that has been submitted desnt have caption in red
    figure 1 make smaller
    figure 3 should be larger
    figure 4 size is too large
