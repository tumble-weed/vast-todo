images-for-elp-paper
- contributions
- which images need to be formatted and how?
        - manually number table
    - table 2(classes 0-9) classes10-19 in heading?
    spaces:
        - below table 2, table 3, qualitative comparion, table 1, fig 2, fig 1
    - keywords?

1.	The novelty of the work is not clear.
...... 2.	The entire manuscript needs to be improved in terms of grammar and style of expression.
3.	The formatting of the manuscript needs improvement and must adhere with IEEE guidelines. 
4.	The table headers must be at the top of the table instead at the bottom.

1. The experimental results show that the proposed method works well. The motivations are good and the proposed Unit is also well devised. The writing is clear as well. Overall, I think this paper is acceptable.

2. I think the introduction part should summarize the contributions.  After reading the introduction, I cannot understand the contributions of this work.

...... 3. I think it is better to analyze the computation complexity of the proposed method and other competitors, such as the inference time. Because this method has 2 stages and multiple iterations. It is needed to analyze this for a more comprehensive comparison with other competitors.

DONE
    - reduce names of conferences
    - table1, table 2 and table 3 caption is too close to the table
    - what is the guideline regarding table caption for icpr
        above th table
    - make sanity checks flat: elp_with_scales_sanity_juco_imagenet_vgg16.drawio.png
    - figure 5 might be too big as well
    figure 4 and 1 convert into horizontal format

        experiments elp-failure-v2.drawio(bold).png             elp-failure-v2-mar17.drawio

    table1 exceeding the margins
    figure 4 has caption in red
        paper that has been submitted desnt have caption in red
    figure 1 make smaller
    figure 3 should be larger
    figure 4 size is too large
    5_experiments_nov18: vspace in Ablation Studies We now investigate these reasons
    experiments: move table 2 before table 3 ( because pointing game is referred to before ablation )
    author list from icip paper
- author list
NOT DOING
    - pointing game table extend the line in the header
    - figure 2 seems small
    - figure 2 vertical?
