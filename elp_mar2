    figure 1 make smaller
    figure 2 seems small
    table1, table 2 and table 3 caption is too close to the table
    figure 3 should be larger
    figure 4 size is too large
    figure 5 might be too big as well
    5_experiments_nov18: vspace in Ablation Studies We now investigate these reasons
    lots of empty space below table 1
    experiments: move table 2 before table 3 ( because pointing game is referred to before ablation )
        manually number table
    what is the guideline regarding table caption for icpr
    figure 2 vertical?
        elp-block-diagram-stage-I-and-II-v2-jan24.drawio.png
    table 2(classes 0-9) classes10-19 in heading?
    spaces:
        below table 2, table 3, qualitative comparion, table 1, fig 2, fig 1

- average tables while getting class scores
- check if the seeds are actually getting communicated ( make some dbg flags)
-per class table in latex?
