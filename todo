=======
- Intro (10 min recheck) crop density seems unintuitive, refine it in some way? 2nd way of taking crops? by actually marking density by considering crop center?
- Approach,LOCAL (10 minutes) in gp inference/input image is left right of image corret? cdpaperimages. seems correct
- Exp (15 min) specify how you took the weights for simple scale and crop
- Exp (15 min) mention that in the plots/images you get the averaged saliency of the mask areas
- Appr Remove "non-object" areas from the text
PPR: active learning
- LTX SRT/SMY (45min) SRT order of images
- LTX SRT/SMY (15 min) reduce height of figures while keeping the width constant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Exp ERC (20 min) confirm the numbers in table are correctly copied
- Exp check (20 min) if per class table correctly highlighted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- DRAW (15 min) in the images some labels look like plain text, should have specialfont?
- (45 min) DRAW: correct images
- Appr DRAW: pixel visibility density
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IMAGES:
>> gaussian process model
- PPR:RUN TODO (example of object/non-object) yak image: 000013.jpg. cow class, 9
- erick pipeline diagram

3>RECHECK:
- >>> PPR Related: lime
>TODO: 
- exact form of u`,v`in paper?
- PPR: step 2.2 described nowere
- PPR SMY Approach: have saumya look over bilinear interpolation (approach)
- PPR SMY Approach: bilinear text seems to take up more space thn the GP text which is your main contribution
- PPR Approach,EP:different areas in EP, as well as areas of the window  
SRT per class tables and bold
<LOCAL> decide on which images show up in the comparison and in the teaser (4 images). check failures_for etc
<LOCAL> teaser is just improved image
- Approach: will need to think about how to change experiment conclusion from focusing on stochasticity to something else
- TODO captions for the figures
- tryvisualize,vimvisualization,gp_saliency etc save intermediate masks (aroudn 200) and final attribution
- PPR (collect_results) Experiments more results: sanity, per class(only if it increases on most classes), stochasticity, window selection density 
- border multiscale perturbation in qualitative results
- (collect_results,rng) add results to table: waiting for rng to end so i can average it
>> comparison of final saliency of some images
>> failure cases
>> pipeline of full method
- ! PPR: teaser image
- PPR: (select_results) explore_results should we do it with an image where the method scores better than simple EP , as well as better than _simple_scale_and_crop_normalized? 
- for visual comparison
    (filebrowser,draw.io) copy images to draw.io
    get failure_for for elp_gp and elp for vgg16,resnet50

SRT reduce space between equations
- add scripts for rclone
- which images are remaining: teaser
- LTX combine 2 per class tables in to 1 
- run the code to save the failure and success again
- SRT insert the 2 images side by side. inset a teaser image. insert the 2 class tables. correct the pointing game table.
- the rank correlation isnt good, how to diagnose? remove the section
- DRAW: CNN
- for upload_torchray also add code for uploading all important directories of the system
- summarize cameras,sess to see if they are actually done
- SMY (elp gp, overlef, syc, make pdf) PPR:Approach: have another look at the algorithm. see notation consistent between algo and text. 
~ everytime i change around the order of which things to do , it needs so many changes: json-->sh, then stopping and running scripts on te machines
- create aliases for different ways of detecting an image(what does this mean:visualizing image?)
    methods to visalize from: EP,Gradient,Guided,GradCAM,RISE
    (select_) get rows to visualize
    !(attribution,dofilelist?) run attribution on the images in the list look at trygradcam
        !make alias to do this in a loop for all methods

dolist for gradcam
dolist for all methods in the paper
