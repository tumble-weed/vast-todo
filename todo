=======
- border multiscale perturbation in qualitative results
- add arrows in stage diagrams as well as STAGE I and STAGE II markers
- in the images some labels look like plain text, should have specialfont?
- specify how you tookthe weights for simple scale and crop
- TODO captions for the figures
- which images are remaining: teaser
- summarize_elp might not work because $UNW is wrong (has - at the end)
- 112: run rank correlation on normalized rng
<LOCAL> teaser is just improved image
=======
- confirm the numbers in table are correctly copied
- get the scores for unweighted ( remember to put them correctly in the table)
- mention that in the plots you get the averaged saliency
- DRAW: correct images
- DRAW: pixel visibility density
- summarize extremal perturbation and recollect all results ( at least not per class)
- PPR check if per class table correctly highlighted
- LTX combine 2 per class tables in to 1 
- PPR add EP,EP-GP tables
- SRT insert the 2 images side by side. inset a teaser image. insert the 2 class tables. correct the pointing game table.
- in gp inference/input image is left right of image corret? cdpaperimages. seems correct
- TITLE multiscale perturbations for improved attribution
SRT arrows in tables ( higher better lower better)
SRT per class tables and bold
<LOCAL> download compare_pointing
<LOCAL> decide on which images show up in the comparison and in the teaser (4 images). check failures_for etc
SRT reduce space between equations
- run the code to save the failure and success again
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- PPR Approach,EP:different areas in EP, as well as areas of the window  
- PPR: step 2.2 described nowere
- PPR SMY Approach: have saumya look over bilinear interpolation (approach)
- PPR SMY Approach: bilinear text seems to take up more space thn the GP text which is your main contribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>TODO: 
- exact form of u`,v`in paper?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- PPR: (select_results) explore_results should we do it with an image where the method scores better than simple EP , as well as better than _simple_scale_and_crop_normalized? 
- for visual comparison
    (filebrowser,draw.io) copy images to draw.io
    get failure_for for elp_gp and elp for vgg16,resnet50
- tryvisualize,vimvisualization,gp_saliency etc save intermediate masks (aroudn 200) and final attribution
- PPR: what if gradcam is better than elp-scales? (it probably is)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- PPR (collect_results) Experiments more results: sanity, per class(only if it increases on most classes), stochasticity, window selection density 
IMAGES:
>> gaussian process model
>> scores of sampled crop centers.
>> comparison of final saliency of some images
>> pipeline of full method
>> failure cases
>> crops and their scores
- ! PPR: teaser image
- PPR:RUN TODO (example of object/non-object) yak image: 000013.jpg. cow class, 9

- PPR intro: red part of intro
- search for [?] and ?? and ? in paper
