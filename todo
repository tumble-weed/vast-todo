>TODO: 
- (elp gp, overlef, syc, make pdf) PPR:Approach: have another look at the algorithm. see notation consistent between algo and text. check it in github elp and overleadf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
resnet50 rng2 4963 (115)
118
resnet50 rng3 6152
vgg16 rng2 6345
vgg16 rng3 6563
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ everytime i change around the order of which things to do , it needs so many changes: json-->sh, then stopping and running scripts on te machines
- 118 will end in 10 hours with resnet50,rng3 what should it take care of next
(gp resnet50 rng3 ), (unweighted 16)
- PPR: (select_results) explore_results should we do it with an image where the method scores better than simple EP , as well as better than _simple_scale_and_crop_normalized? 
- for visual comparison
    (filebrowser,draw.io) copy images to draw.io
    get failure_for for elp_gp and elp for vgg16,resnet50
- tryvisualize,vimvisualization,gp_saliency etc save intermediate masks (aroudn 200) and final attribution
- PPR: what if gradcam is better than elp-scales? (it probably is)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- PPR (collect_results) Experiments more results: sanity, per class(only if it increases on most classes), stochasticity, window selection density 
IMAGES:
>> gaussian process model
>> scores of sampled crop centers.
>> comparison of final saliency of some images
>> pipeline of full method
>> failure cases
>> crops and their scores
- ! PPR: teaser image
- ! PPR: can i plan out the images. what if all the effort on the diagram is wrong
- PPR:RUN TODO (example of object/non-object) yak image: 000013.jpg. cow class, 9
- erick pipeline diagram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- PPR Approach,EP:different areas in EP, as well as areas of the window  
- PPR: step 2.2 described nowere
- PPR Approach: have saumya look over bilinear interpolation (approach)
- PPR Approach: bilinear text seems to take up more space thn the GP text which is your main contribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- PPR: average the results of rngs. not going to write a script for it.
- (collect_reslts,rng) add results to table: waiting for rng to end so i can average it
- PPR intro: red part of intro
- search for [?] and ?? and ? in paper
