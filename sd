what is the mask in controlnet
https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet/discussions/434


can i use reference or adain to multiply the gem area?
can i use depth segmentation to acquire the text area?
controlnet tiling to replicate the diamond area?
controlnet outpainting to replicate the diamond area?
better textual inversion for the given image?

use this idea:
get the bgsubtraction of the styled image
get the style from it
somehow tile the style
get the mask from the text image
multiply it by the style...
pass it to the refinement module
