- bending wires into shapes
- 3d inversion
- why did point cloud inversion fail
- gaussian processes with a multi scale kernel 
- class transitions
- information theoretic clustering
- learning to interpolate
- gan duck sliding
- crossing the divide between explanation and segmentation
- generative  attribution method
- interpolating between faces using a single mask
- cosaliency of the same object between 2 images
- separating multiple objects vs general objectness
- is the network seeing that object or some other object? --> feature deviation (fg --> fg +bg) what about feature differences? ref_feat - fg_feat = bg_feat?
- 2 sided masks with imposition that fg_feat + bg_feat = ref_feat?
- accentuating the difference between 2 neural networks ( 1 mask, start from where they disagree the most )
- longitudnal visualization ( across the training run)
