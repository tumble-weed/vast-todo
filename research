- crossing the divide between explanation and segmentation
    - superpixel based saliency
        . different from igos as it will use cluster centers
        . different from igos as uses features
        . look at XAI?
        . why do it insitu with the optimization when you can pre-create superpixels?
- class agnostic saliency. if you didnt know which classes were in the image.
- relation between attribution and visualization
- relation between attribution and gradient descent
- 3d inversion
    - bending wires into shapes
- why did point cloud inversion fail
- gaussian processes with a multi scale kernel 
- class transitions
- information theoretic clustering
    . how do lstms induce stop signal
    . use gan for image quality
    . a model that converts lstm bits to an image
Adversarial Examples
    - adversarial phenomenon
    - innocuous noise
GANS:
    - gan duck sliding
    - why does singan collapse
Feature Inversion:
    inverting random networks to observe effect of initialization
    
- generative attribution method
- separating multiple objects vs general objectness
- "gradient based saliency is more flexible allowing for measuring saliency of arbitary losses"
    - where does this loss attend to ? ( e.g. focal loss), do we need ||dloss/dx|| ?
    - for a GAN which part of the image is important to the Discriminator early on, later on in the training?
- inverting random cnns and transformers to observe inductive biases
Multithresholded Saliency
    - cosaliency of the same object between 2 images
    - is the network seeing that object or some other object? --> feature deviation (fg --> fg +bg) 
        what about feature differences? ref_feat - fg_feat = bg_feat?
    - 2 sided masks with imposition that fg_feat + bg_feat = ref_feat?
    - accentuating the difference between 2 neural networks ( 1 mask, start from where they disagree the most )
    - longitudnal visualization ( across the training run)
    - can you improve the performance of vgg16 by masking its images by the attribution of resnet50?
    - ranking based loss
    - gan discriminator longitudnal saliency
    - interpolating between faces using a single mask
