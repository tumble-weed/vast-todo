- crossing the divide between explanation and segmentation
    - superpixel based saliency
        . different from igos as it will use cluster centers
        . different from igos as uses features
        . look at XAI?
        . why do it insitu with the optimization when you can pre-create superpixels?
- class agnostic saliency. if you didnt know which classes were in the image.
- relation between attribution and visualization
- relation between attribution and gradient descent
- why does singan collapse
- 3d inversion
    - bending wires into shapes
- why did point cloud inversion fail
- gaussian processes with a multi scale kernel 
- class transitions
- information theoretic clustering
    . how do lstms induce stop signal
    . use gan for image quality
    . a model that converts lstm bits to an image
- adversarial phenomenon
- gan duck sliding
- generative  attribution method
- interpolating between faces using a single mask
- separating multiple objects vs general objectness
- invariant noise
Multithresholded Saliency
    - cosaliency of the same object between 2 images
    - is the network seeing that object or some other object? --> feature deviation (fg --> fg +bg) 
        what about feature differences? ref_feat - fg_feat = bg_feat?
    - 2 sided masks with imposition that fg_feat + bg_feat = ref_feat?
    - accentuating the difference between 2 neural networks ( 1 mask, start from where they disagree the most )
    - longitudnal visualization ( across the training run)
    - can you improve the performance of vgg16 by masking its images by the attribution of resnet50?
